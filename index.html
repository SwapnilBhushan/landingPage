          When Triumph Engineering went into receivership in 1983, John Bloor
          bought the name and manufacturing rights from the Official Receiver.
          The new company's manufacturing plant was outdated and unable to
          compete against the technology from Japanese manufacturers, so Bloor
          decided against relaunching Triumph immediately. Initially, production
          of the old Bonneville was continued under licence by Les Harris of
          Racing Spares, in Newton Abbot, Devon, to bridge the gap between the
          end of the old company and the start of the new company. For five
          years from 1983, about 14 a week were built at peak production. In the
          United States, owing to problems with liability insurance, the Harris
          Bonnevilles were never imported. Modified 2014 Triumph Scrambler
          Triumph 900 cc Adventurer, first variation of the popular Triumph
          Thunderbird 900 triple Bloor set to work assembling the then-new
          Triumph business, hiring several of the group's former designers to
          begin work on new models. The team visited Japan on a tour of its
          competitors' facilities and decided to adopt Japanese manufacturing
          techniques and especially new-generation computer-controlled
          machinery. In 1985, Triumph purchased a first set of equipment to
          begin working, in secret, on its new prototype models. By 1987, the
          company had completed its first engine. In 1988, Bloor funded the
          building of a new factory at a 10-acre (40,000 m2) site in Hinckley,
          Leicestershire.The first Hinckley Triumphs were produced for the 1991
          model year. Bloor put between £70 million and £100 million into the
          company between purchasing the brand and breaking even in 2000. At the
          same time as production capacity increased, Bloor established a new
          network of export distributors. He had previously created two
          subsidiary companies, Triumph Deutschland GmbH and Triumph France SA.
          In 1994, Bloor created Triumph Motorcycles America Ltd. At 21:00 on 15
          March 2002, as the company was preparing to celebrate its 100th
          anniversary as a motorcycle maker, half of the main factory including
          the assembly area and stores was destroyed by a fire which began at
          the rear of the facility. At the height of the blaze, over 100
          firefighters with 30 vehicles were tackling the fire. Nevertheless,
          the company, which by then employed more than 650, quickly rebuilt the
          facility and returned to production by September that year. In May
          2002, Triumph began construction on a new sub-assembly manufacturing
          facility in Chonburi, Thailand to make various components.A second
          factory was opened in 2006 by Prince Andrew, Duke of York where a wet
          painting facility and assembly line have been established.A third
          factory was opened in 2007 to include high pressure die-casting and
          machining, and Triumph announced that they were expanding to increase
          capacity to over 130,000 motorcycles.Triumph Motorcycles (Thailand)
          Limited is a 100% UK owned company and now employs about 1000
          staff.[10] In June 2009 Digby Jones, Baron Jones of Birmingham, the
          former Minister of State for Trade, became chairman and the 1,600 cc
          (98 cu in) Thunderbird twin-cylinder cruiser was announced.[vague] In
          early 2011 Nick Bloor, John Bloor's son, took over from Tue Mantoni as
          CEO of Triumph Motorcycles and in 2017 Triumph opened a new £4 million
          visitor centre, along with a collection of Triumph motorcycles,
          memorabilia, and a factory tour.In February 2020 it was announced that
          Triumph would be moving the remainder of large scale motorcycle
          production, including the Tiger 1200 and Speed Triple production lines
          to their Thailand factories, leaving only the specialist Triumph
          Factory Customs and prototype builds remaining in the UK. Whilst the
          R&D department remains within the UK (and 20 additional staff have
          been taken on in that department), substantially larger redundancies
          were announced amongst production staff.
